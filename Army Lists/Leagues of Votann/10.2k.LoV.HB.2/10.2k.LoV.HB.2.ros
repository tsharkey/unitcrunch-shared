Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is removed from the battlefield, make a note of how many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next to it. If a unit with Judgement tokens splits up into two or more smaller units, each of those units gains a number of Judgement tokens equal to that of the original unit. If two units combine to form a single larger unit and either of those units had Judgement tokens, make a note of how many the unit with the most has, just before they combine – the new unit has a number of Judgement tokens equal to this.</description></rule><rule id="b4dd-3e1f-41cb-218f" name="Leader" hidden="false" page="39"><description>While a Bodyguard unit contains a Leader, it is known as an Attached unit and, with the exception of rules that are triggered when units are destroyed (pg 12), it is treated as a single unit for all rules purposes. Each time an attack targets an Attached unit, until the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks, you must use the Toughness characteristic of the Bodyguard models in that unit, even if a Leader in that unit has a different Toughness characteristic. Each time an attack successfully wounds an Attached unit, that attack cannot be allocated to a Character model in that unit, even if that Character model has lost one or more wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase. As soon as the last Bodyguard model in an Attached unit has been destroyed, any attacks made against that unit that have yet to be allocated can then be allocated to Character models in that unit.

Each time the last model in a Bodyguard unit is destroyed, each CHARACTER unit that is part of that Attached unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. 

Each time the last model in a CHARACTER unit that is attached to a Bodyguard unit is destroyed and there is not another CHARACTER unit attached, that Attached unit’s Bodyguard unit becomes a separate unit, with its original Starting Strength. If this happens as the result of an attack, they become separate units after the attacking unit has resolved all of its attacks. 

Each time a unit that is part of an Attached unit is destroyed, it does not have the keywords of any other units that make up that Attached unit (unless it has those keywords on its own datasheet) for the purposes of any rules that would be triggered when that unit is destroyed.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="2e4d-3b38-ed87-7de2" name="Kâhl" hidden="false" typeId="c547-1836-d8a-ff4f" typeName="Unit" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="M" typeId="e703-ecb6-5ce7-aec1">5&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="T" typeId="d29d-cf75-fc2d-34a4">5</characteristic><characteristic name="SV" typeId="450-a17e-9d5e-29da">3+</characteristic><characteristic name="W" typeId="750a-a2ec-90d3-21fe">4</characteristic><characteristic name="LD" typeId="58d2-b879-49c7-43bc">7+</characteristic><characteristic name="OC" typeId="bef7-942a-1a23-59f8">1</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="2769-d6d8-29c8-7689" name="Kindred Hero" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">While this model is leading a unit, weapons equipped by models in that unit have the [LETHAL HITS] ability.</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="7139-216a-b740-0af3" name="Leader" hidden="false" typeId="9cc3-6d83-4dd3-9b64" typeName="Abilities" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Description" typeId="9b8f-694b-e5e-b573">This model can be attached to the following units:

Each time a model from your army with this ability makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or more Judgement tokens, until that model’s attacks have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus from the table below to that attack.

1. Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.
2. Now We’ve Got a Grudge to Settle: Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to the Wound roll.

Designer’s Note: If a unit with Judgement tokens is removed from the battlefield, make a note of how many Judgement tokens it had when it was removed. If that unit is set up on the battlefield again, place the corresponding number of Judgement tokens next to it.

These attacks can destroy enemy models in a target unit even though none may have been visible to the attacking unit when you selected that target.


If no models in a target unit are visible to the attacking unit when you select that target, then each time a model in the attacking unit makes an attack against that target using an Indirect Fire weapon, subtract 1 from that attack’s Hit roll, an unmodified Hit roll of 1-3 always fails, and the target has the Benefit of Cover against that attack. Weapons with the [TORRENT] ability cannot be fired using the [INDIRECT FIRE] ability.</description></rule></rules><profiles><profile id="b33d-4770-45ec-de79" name="Mole grenade launcher" hidden="false" typeId="f77d-b953-8fa4-b762" typeName="Ranged Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="9896-9419-16a1-92fc">24&quot;</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="3bb-c35f-f54-fb08">D6</characteristic><characteristic name="BS" typeId="94d-8a98-cf90-183e">4+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="2229-f494-25db-c5d3">5</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="9ead-8a10-520-de15">-1</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="a354-c1c8-a745-f9e3">1</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="7f1b-8591-2fcf-d01c">Blast, Indirect Fire</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles></selection><selection id="m6hv28ougbxq61pruuq" name="Heavy plasma axe" entryId="7ae6-5074-5aed-9b38::697f-710e-738d-4ee3" entryGroupId="7ae6-5074-5aed-9b38::2d71-3e85-019a-2556" number="1" type="upgrade" from="group" group="Weapon"><profiles><profile id="3a57-f678-8ddb-1965" name="➤ Heavy plasma axe - strike" hidden="false" typeId="8a40-4aaa-c780-9046" typeName="Melee Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="914c-b413-91e3-a132">Melee</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="2337-daa1-6682-b110">3</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="95d1-95f-45b4-11d6">3+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="ab33-d393-96ce-ccba">6</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="41a0-1301-112a-e2f2">-2</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="3254-9fe6-d824-513e">2</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="893f-9000-ccf7-648e">-</characteristic></characteristics></profile><profile id="a7ec-1ddf-02b0-147c" name="➤ Heavy plasma axe - sweep" hidden="false" typeId="8a40-4aaa-c780-9046" typeName="Melee Weapons" from="entry"><characteristics><characteristic name="Range" typeId="914c-b413-91e3-a132">Melee</characteristic><characteristic name="A" typeId="2337-daa1-6682-b110">6</characteristic><characteristic name="WS" typeId="95d1-95f-45b4-11d6">3+</characteristic><characteristic name="S" typeId="ab33-d393-96ce-ccba">4</characteristic><characteristic name="AP" typeId="41a0-1301-112a-e2f2">-1</characteristic><characteristic name="D" typeId="3254-9fe6-d824-513e">1</characteristic><characteristic name="Keywords" typeId="893f-9000-ccf7-648e">-</characteristic></characteristics></profile></profiles></selection></selections></selection><selection id="m6hv28o6nignatqtpz" name="Beserk w/ twin concussion gauntlets" entryId="7ae6-5074-5aed-9b38::4894-87e8-1f3a-a7d9" entryGroupId="7ae6-5074-5aed-9b38::6eb4-83c6-3025-a19c" number="1" type="model" from="group" group="5 - 10 Beserks"><selections><selection id="m6hv28owrum676xvk2" name="Twin concussion gauntlets" entryId="7ae6-5074-5aed-9b38::aa25-d47f-18c5-23f3" number="1" type="upgrade" from="entry"><rules><rule id="cf93-ad4d-2f08-a79d" name="Twin-linked" hidden="false" page="25"><description>Weapons with [TWIN-LINKED] in their profile are known as Twin-linked weapons.
